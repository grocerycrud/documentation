# getState


<pre><code class="language-php">string getState()</code></pre>
Simply get the state as a string. This is useful when you need to add a very specific implementation that it is outside of grocery CRUD Enterprise. A common usage to use the <code>getState</code> method is mainly if you need to have some permissions checks. Of course as this is something custom, you can specify the usage for <code>getState</code> for your own needs.

Below you can find the list of possible states for Grocery CRUD Enterprise edition that we have so far:

- AddForm
- AjaxSearch
- BlobView
- CloneForm
- Clone
- Datagrid
- DependedRelation
- EditForm
- ExportPdf
- Export
- Initial
- Insert
- Main
- PrintPage
- Print
- ReadForm
- RemoveMultiple
- RemoveOne
- Update
- UploadMultiple
- Upload

The most important states that are not so obvious to understand straight away are:

- `Main` state is the state where all the assets and some basic resources are loaded.
Keep in mind that this state doesn't have any calls to the database to make sure that at least the Main state 
will always load
- `Initial` state is the state where all the basic info for the CRUD is loaded only the first time we load our CRUD.
- `Datagrid` state is the request for the datagrid data. In simple words the data list that we load in the beginning
and for every search, ordering and any operation of the CRUD table.

## Example
<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->setTable('customers');
$crud->setSubject('Customer', 'Customers');

if ($crud->getState() === 'EditForm') {
    // Mocking a minimal response of GroceryCRUD with an error message
    // Custom error and json response with an error message is only available on Enterprise version
    $output = (object)[
        'isJSONResponse' => true,
        'output' => json_encode(
            (object)[
                'message' => 'It seems that you don\'t have access to edit this customer.',
                'status' => 'failure'
            ]
        )
    ];
} else {
    $output = $crud->render();
}</code></pre>

You can check the result of the above code below. Simply try to edit any customer. The above code is just an example, 
and we also agree that if this was a production code it would be a bad UX experience ðŸ˜ƒ
