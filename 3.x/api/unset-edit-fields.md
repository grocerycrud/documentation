# unsetEditFields

<pre><code class="language-php">unsetEditFields(array $fields)</code></pre>
There are cases that we have lots of fields and we just need to say "I need all of them expect these 3". Well <code>unsetEditFields</code> is doing just that! This function is really useful especially when the development of the database is on going. The syntax is simple:

<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->unsetEditFields(['address_1', 'address_2', 'credit_limit']);</code></pre>

You can see a full working example below:

<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->setTable('customers');
$crud->setSubject('Customer', 'Customers');
$crud->setRead();
$crud->unsetEditFields(['salesRepEmployeeNumber','creditLimit']);

$output = $crud->render();</code></pre>

As you can also see by your own at the below live example, in every area all the fields/columns are visible <strong>expect</strong> the ones at the edit form modal. More specifically you will notice that the fields "salesRepEmployeeNumber" and "creditLimit" are missing when you press "Edit Customer" in any row:
