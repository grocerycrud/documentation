Below you can take a taste of how the new version of Grocery CRUD looks like. Since this is still in a beta version, in
case you find any bugs please do let me know on [info@grocerycrud.com](mailto:info@grocerycrud.com)

<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->setTable('customers');
$crud->setSubject('Customer', 'Customers');
$crud->columns(['customerName','phone','addressLine1','creditLimit']);

$output = $crud->render();
</code></pre>
