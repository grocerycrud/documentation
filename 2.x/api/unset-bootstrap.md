# unsetBootstrap


<pre><code class="language-php">unsetBootstrap(void)</code></pre>
A common usage of GroceryCRUD is to be used in an already existing admin template or an already existing project. As twitter bootstrap is the most common CSS library for many templates it is important to be loaded only once and to not be conflicted with Grocery CRUD. Grocery CRUD is clever enough to not have conflicts on Bootstrap JavaScript libraries, so you don't have to worry about them at all. However, for CSS you should use the <code>unsetBootstrap</code> function to disable the load of bootstrap CSS from Grocery CRUD.

The syntax is simple as it doesn't require any parameters. For example:
<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->unsetBootstrap()</code></pre>

With the above code, the CSS of twitter bootstrap is removed. It is important to be aware of that as you need to make sure that the template offers the required CSS for bootstrap before using the function <code>unsetBootstrap</code>

You can see a full example below:
<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->setTable('customers');
$crud->setSubject('Customer', 'Customers');
$crud->columns(['customerName','phone','addressLine1','creditLimit']);

$output = $crud->render();</code></pre>

The result of the above code you can see it here. However it is hard for you to see the difference! So in order to do that you will need see the source of this page (by pressing right click "View Page Source"). At the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag at the top, you can see that the bootstrap CSS is loaded from the template and not Grocery CRUD. This is because the site that you are looking at the moment has the twitter bootstrap as base and didn't want to have conflicts. So basically... this website is using this method as well :)
