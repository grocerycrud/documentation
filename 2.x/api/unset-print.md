# unsetPrint

<pre><code class="language-php">unsetPrint(void)</code></pre>
The method <code>unsetPrint</code> is removing completely the Print operation for the end-user. More specifically:
<ol>
   <li>It is removing the button "Print"</li>
   <li>The user doesn't have the ability to get data for print operation even if they try to do it by having the URL of the API (e.g. the permission is not allowed)</li>
</ol>

The syntax is simple. You can find an example below:
<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->unsetPrint();</code></pre>

You can also see a full working example:

<pre><code class="language-php">$crud->setTable('customers');
$crud->setSubject('Customer', 'Customers');
$crud->columns(['customerName','phone','addressLine1','creditLimit']);
$crud->unsetPrint();

$output = $crud->render();</code></pre>

You can see the results of the above example here. As you can see by your own, the operation Print is completely removed:
