# Why grocery CRUD?

Grocery CRUD is not just another CRUD generator or just another codeigniter grid generator. It is a totally different idea and... more simple idea! With few simple PHP lines of code you can have all the functionality that you need to create your CRUD. So this means you don't have to copy the same Javascripts,CSS, views,models,vaildation rules,html code, grid, upload functionality ... e.t.c . again and again. To create again a CRUD for a different table you will just need simple PHP lines of code.

The good part is that you don't even have to change the CSS to make it more user friendly. Grocery CRUD is ready for the production mode with all the required security and views.
 
**Grocery CRUD is an automatic CRUD generator**, and it can cover almost all your needs for a CRUD system (simple or complex one) as it has many features and still keep going.

Some main features of grocery CRUD are:
- datagrid listing with paging, sorting, searching by field and search for all with ajax (flexigrid theme) or instant javascript scripting (datatables theme)
- automatic creation of inputs by field type. Till now the field types that auto-generate different inputs are: integer, string, text, date, datetime, set, enum, true_false(0 or 1), hidden, password and readonly
- database relation 1-1 , 1-n and n-n , automatically with just one line of code
- changing themes easlily, so far there are two themes , datatables and flexigrid
- validation form with client side validation and server side validation
- adding your own validation rules
- flexibility to choose columns and fields that you want to add to your table
- unset operation like unset add, edit or delete
- callbacks almost everywhere to do your own customizations
- changing the auto generate field type, for example a text field can transform easily to date field
- want to do something more complex? In grocery CRUD you can add your own model by extending the basic model
